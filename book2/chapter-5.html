            <h1>A switch to fixed pricing</h1>

            <p>From the beginning, Wolf&#8217;s Little Store has been a service based business. I work on websites, web apps and mobile designs for clients based on an hourly fee.</p>
            <p>If there is a new project, I will give an estimate based on that hourly fee. For example, if my hourly fee was €60 and a website would take 40 hours to finish the total cost would be €2400.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I would work more hours than agreed upon, mostly to make the end result better.</p>
            <p>Let&#8217;s say I was working on a new website and the web was abuzz about retina displays. I would make the extra effort to put retina images in.</p>
            <p>Going the extra mile like this has a few obvious disadvantages: it will take longer, and you&#8217;re going to encounter unsolved problems. The perceived value to the client is low. I default to making responsive websites, and these days I will make an extra effort to make everything as retina-ready as I can.</p>
            <p>I do it because I believe it makes my work better, but it effectively hurts your bottom line. The fee is for &#8220;work&#8221;, not for &#8220;learning&#8221;, experimentation or &#8220;fiddling around&#8221;. In the end you are hurting your business by spending time on this and not on something new.</p>
            <p>The advantages then: your work is cutting edge. Consistently delivering quality should put you at the top of your field and thus should enable you to command higher rates.</p>
            <p>Back to our example project.</p>
            <p>Let&#8217;s say you don&#8217;t go the extra mile and you finish this 40 hour project in 35 hours.</p>
            <p>Or maybe you are really skilled at the task at hand and you finish early because of your experience.</p>
            <p>What do you do? Bill the client 35 hours of work? I did this a few times until I realized I never got any thanks for actually lowering the initial agreed fee, and I was hurting my bottom line by being honest.</p>
            <p>But when you actually want to bill more than the initial agreed fee &#8212; even though the scope was expanded &#8212; tough negotiations had to be made. Ideally, any change in pricing has to be communicated before the (extra) work is done.</p>
            <p>In the end most of it comes down to the fact that you want to get paid for your work and the other party wants to pay as little as possible.</p>
            <p>There is some middle ground, and I&#8217;m not saying everyone always tries to get what is best for them [financially].</p>
            <p>I want to spent my time designing, not arguing about money. I don&#8217;t want to spend 10% of the day moving around time records and tracking everything.</p>
            <p>So, what happens in most companies, they make an offer for 40 hours of work at €60/h, they finish the project, and they bill 40 hours. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the project got finished in 20 or 60 hours, 40 hours will be billed.</p>
            <p>So effectively most agencies/companies in the service business are doing fixed pricing with a magic variable in between there that can be used at will in negotiations: &#8220;we are nearing the budget&#8221; &#8220;we are at halfway point&#8221; &#8220;we worked 60 hours and went the extra mile but we will of course only bill the initial agreed fee&#8221;.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the variable matches up with reality &#8212; I know my estimates are fairly accurate which is why my system has worked so far &#8212; but sometimes it&#8217;s out of touch.</p>
            <p>In my mind, if you actually bill 40 hours of work when you worked 30 hours, then you are lying. It&#8217;s a common thing in business, but it&#8217;s still lying.</p>
            <p>This happens all the time, it&#8217;s not new. An unwelcome side effect from an agency trying to collect as many billable hours from their clients as possible, is that their service level actually lowers.</p>
            <p>Let&#8217;s illustrate this last point with a new example.</p>
            <p>You are tasked with building an HTML e-mail newsletter, it should be released ASAP.</p>
            <p>You have divine HTML e-mail skills because you spent too much time in the table-drenched HTML trenches back in the days, so you can do this job in 2 hours, looking great in every e-mail clients, tested in Outlook 2007 et al.</p>
            <p>Let&#8217;s say the market value of this job is 6 hours of work at €60/h. So €360.</p>
            <p>You can do this in 2 hours, but nobody would agree on hiring a designer at €180/h. That kind of hourly billing is lawyer/very specific consultant/good trader only.</p>
            <p>The newsletter has to be released ASAP so actual value to the company is higher if you can do it in 2 hours instead of 6 hours.</p>
            <p>2 hours instead of 6 hours will probably also mean that you can finish the job within that day as opposed to the next business day (effective time passed: 24+ hours).</p>
            <p>A lot of businesses will now finish the job today and deliver the product tomorrow, so their hourly estimates match up with reality. Everyone knows this is BS, but it is accepted.</p>
            <p>I could delve deeper into this: companies will often try to find more billable hours. What task could we do for [company X] to make sure we can keep our billables up? Sometimes a lot of money switches hands but not a lot is  actually happening.</p>
            <p>I am switching my pricing over to fixed pricing because it&#8217;s the logical thing to do.</p>
            <p>I will decide the price of a project based on</p>
            <ul>
            <li>What the job is</li>
            <li>The value created (see <a href="http://v3.wolfslittlestore.be/2012/04/22/value-created-vs-time-spent/">previous musings</a>)</li>
            <li>How long it will take me</li>
            <li>How exciting the job is (i.e. if it&#8217;s something new and exciting I will probably have to be paid less to do it)</li>
            <li>The market value of the project (what does it usually cost to do X?)</li>
            <li>The deadline (do you need it by tonight?)</li>
            <li>My workload (I can only work a certain amount)</li>
            <li>My relationship with the client (if I like you/have gotten a lot of work from you in the past you will get better rates)
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I don&#8217;t know if this is going to work &#8212; I believe it&#8217;s the right thing to do, but I bet a lot of people are not used to working this way.</p>
