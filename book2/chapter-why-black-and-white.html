            <p>Well&#8230; This is a question that pop-up&#8217;s every now and then. For me the answer is very simple, but I&#8217;ll try to explain it a bit a wider range. First of all, it&#8217;s a personal decision to make it Black &amp; White. Sure, many photographers make this decision. But for me, color is just disturbing and distracting.  Black &amp; White reduces the photograph to forms, patterns and content. Color normally don&#8217;t add anything to a photograph. Especially nowadays where the city is such colourful and you will have too much colour in a photograph. Maybe I should show you some examples, where colours are really disturbing.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/1110175.jpg" width="300" height="225" /><img src="images/1110175-Version-2.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></p>

            <p>As you can see, the image above looks much more dramatic in Black &amp; White, but more like a snapshot in colour. Nobody would prefer this in colour, I guess. Let&#8217;s look another example. My most interesting photo on Flickr:</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><img title="" src="images/P1240558.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /><img title="" src="images/P1240558-Version-2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>

            <p>It&#8217;s not that bad, because there are not so many colours in the photograph. But still, I would prefer it in Black &amp; White as the benches in brown don&#8217;t add anything to the image. Let&#8217;s look at another example.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/OMDS2870.jpg" rel="lightbox[496]"><br />
            <img title="" src="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/OMDS2870-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/OMDS2870-Version-2.jpg" rel="lightbox[496]"><img title="" src="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/OMDS2870-Version-2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/OMDS2870.jpg"><br />
            </a></p>

            <p>Here the bench colour is really dominant and distracts from the foot and the jeans. I would never ever leave this in colour as it is not adding anything to it. Here is an even worse example. I didn&#8217;t remember the girls dress, but this doesn&#8217;t work in colour.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1230170.jpg" rel="lightbox[496]"><img title="" src="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1230170-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><a href="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1230170-Version-2.jpg" rel="lightbox[496]"><img title="" src="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1230170-Version-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><a href="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1230170.jpg"><br />
            </a></p>

            <p>In the end a Black &amp; White shot looks more classic, timeless, dramatic and so on. Colour very seldom adds something to a shot. If it does, I leave it in colour, but this is seldom the case. I work with faces, emotions, lines, forms, patterns and much more. For this I don&#8217;t need any drop of colour. A photograph can work very well without any kind colour .</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1230228.jpg" rel="lightbox[496]"><img title="" src="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1230228-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><a href="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1230228-Version-2.jpg" rel="lightbox[496]"><img title="" src="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1230228-Version-2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><a href="http://www.eye5.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/P1230228.jpg"><br />

            <p>I hope, that I could give some answers to those who asked the question about why I shoot in Black &amp; White. If you still are not wondering, you may try it out yourself. Maybe I choose objects that would work better in Black &amp; White rather than in colour. I have not thought too much about it. In the end I normally choose the version which works better and this is in 99% of the cases Black &amp; White. There are so many examples I could show. But this is all my personal choice, if you choose colour, then it would be fine as well&#8230;</p>
