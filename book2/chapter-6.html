            <h1>Going pro</h1>

            <p>(This is a repost from a post at my <a href="http://johanronsse.be">new photography website</a>)</p>
            <p><em>TL;DR: aside from being a freelance designer, I&#8217;m starting as a freelance photographer.</em></p>
            <p>Over the past two days I&#8217;ve been building <a href="http://johanronsse.be/">a new website</a>. It&#8217;s the site you&#8217;re visiting right now.</p>
            <p>It consists of a portfolio and a blog. The goal of this website is to promote my commercial photography. I&#8217;m still a bit scared to call myself a &#8220;photographer&#8221; but I&#8217;m very very serious about going forward with this.</p>
            <p>My passion for photography got a major boost when I started my 365 project a few months ago (post a photo to a blog every day &#8211; see the archives of this blog) and I&#8217;m ready to take it further. To this end, I will start taking on photography assignments and will actively be pursuing them.</p>
            <p>I know this will be a slow process, probably starting off with small assignments, learning along the way.</p>
            <p>I don&#8217;t fancy myself a high-end super-skilled photographer, but I think there&#8217;s work out there that I can definitely handle, and where I can deliver a professional result.</p>
            <p>Some businesses might benefit from the fact that I can deliver branding, design and photography in 1 package. I see a lot of photographers out there that &#8212; while taking pictures I can only dream of making &#8212; frame them in ugly websites or watermark them so much that their careful composition is ruined.</p>
            <p>Let me tell you a bit of my &#8220;photography&#8221; story. I bought my first second hand DSLR in 2007. It was a Nikon D70. I started photographing concerts and events in my free time.</p>
            <p>I learned a bit about photography but after a while the camera started gathering dust while I concentrated on my job as a web designer for a web design company called Netlash (now <a href="http://wijs.be/">Wijs</a>). </p>
            <p>I worked there for a couple of years learning all I could about web design. The company started doing other things (SEO, SEA, marketing etc.). I felt ready to make a career jump so I decided to go freelance as a UI designer.</p>
            <p>Under the name <a href="http://wolfslittlestore.be">Wolf&#8217;s Little Store</a> I design user interfaces for software. These days it&#8217;s mostly iOS/Android/Windows Metro interfaces. Aside from that, it&#8217;s varied work: sometimes UX work for large-scale backends, sometimes a small website for a new company.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to summer 2011, the Nikon D7000 is out and I&#8217;m buying one. This kind of marked the start of getting back into photography. The kind of photos you can take with that camera are pretty amazing. I don&#8217;t want to get into a gear debate here but better gear definitely gets you better results.</p>
            <p>I started expanding my skills. I learned about off-camera lighting (&#8220;strobist&#8221;), I took a course on flash photography. I got a driver&#8217;s license and I have a car available. If that last part seems unrelated, it&#8217;s actually very important for shoots.</p>
            <p>I shot more and more and to keep things going and to keep learning I started the 365 project. The goal of that project was to post a picture to a blog every day. I&#8217;ve been doing that for over 100 days now and it&#8217;s been great.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s been so great in fact that I want to keep doing this. But I also want to keep the design side going. Why not both? So &#8211; from now I&#8217;m not a freelance designer anymore but a freelance designer/photographer.</p>
            <p>This site contains a selection of my best work. Over the next few months I&#8217;m aiming to expand it with more commercial looking work to give potential &#8220;buyers&#8221; a better idea of what I do.</p>
            <p>Thanks for your attention and if you have any feedback, drop me a line or <a href="http://johanronsse.be/2012/07/25/going-pro/">post a comment</a>!</p>
