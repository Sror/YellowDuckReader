            <h1>Flatland aesthetic</h1>

            <p>A blog post called &#8220;<a href="http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/32267022219/flat-interface-design">The Flat Design Era</a>&#8221; has been going the rounds the last few days.</p>
            <p>I&#8217;ve long been a fan of flat design; if you would give me a blank canvas to draw all UI elements for an OS the end result would probably resemble Metro more than iOS.</p>
            <p>In any case, one problem with the &#8220;flat design&#8221; aesthetic is that it&#8217;s hard to make out what parts of the UI you can actually interact with.</p>
            <p>When the only difference between a button and a background is the size of the container, things can get confusing. </p>
            <p>A button should look like a button.</p>
            <p>Text that can be interacted with should be styled differently than other text.</p>
            <p>Links should have consistent colors.</p>
            <p>Here&#8217;s a good example: <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/about">Khoi Vinh</a>&#8216;s web site. Is that bold text or a link?</p>
            <p>From an aesthetic perspective that page looks mighty fine. From a usability perspective, one could argue that links need to be visible colors. Another standpoint might argue that people will find out soon enough because of the hover state (an argument that no longer holds true in this touch device era),</p>
            <p>These things might help a button look like a button: inset highlight/shadow, drop shadow, a background change, a text color change, a gradient, rounded corners, a border.</p>
            <p>iOS buttons have all of these elements (they have been toned down a bit in iOS6, which I can only applaud) . Most Metro buttons only have a background and text change.</p>
            <p>What&#8217;s best then? As always, it depends. Consistency is the most important thing. </p>
            <p>If you really want to, you could make everything black, but then everything that is not clickable needs to be grey enough to see the difference.</p>
